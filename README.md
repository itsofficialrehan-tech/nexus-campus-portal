🚀 Nexus Campus Portal

A unified digital platform designed to streamline campus life by integrating academic resources, grievance handling, and opportunity discovery into a single, scalable ecosystem.

🧩 Problem Statement

Modern campus systems often operate in silos — grievance portals, academic tracking, internship listings, and announcements exist on separate platforms. This fragmentation leads to poor user experience, inefficiency, and lack of transparency.

Nexus Campus addresses this problem by providing a centralized, role-based digital campus portal that connects students, faculty, and administrators through a single interface.
